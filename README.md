Artist Statement

Jason Hao Huang is an artist who grew up in New York City. He enjoys working in the coffee industry and playing games in his free time.

Inspired by nostalgic retro adventure games, this piece tries to emulate the same feeling of a text based role-playing game. While simplistic, he hopes the text driven interactive story will appeal to those who play through it.  \n"
The concept represents my worries in life; thinking about what would happen if I had made a certain decision in certain situations. This is why a role-playing format was essential to this thought process. 

Having different choices and being able to replay them for different endings, is my take on coping with the what-if's in life.
The stories played through are lightly based off real life experiences, with some based off real events, and some fiction.

Please, do enjoy this mini-experience.


Concept 

My goal is to emulate an old school role playing or choose your own adventure game, via processing. 
Instead of the usual theme of medieval or fantasy setting with magic, monsters and treasure, it will be more modern.

There will be a story implemented, and different “paths” depending on which option and it leads to certain dialogues.

Some paths can be retracted allowing the option to take a step back to the previous decision, but some will not.
Restricting choices and different options will lead to different set endings. 


# Reference 

I borrowed code from a forum for a person doing a similar concept.
It seems that most of the code refers to arrays and custom void functions and classes.
